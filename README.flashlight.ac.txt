Before running flashlight, you will need to navigate to that directory and run 'npm install'.
Flashlight configuration is managed from ./flashlight/config.js.
If running on the server, the host information will need to be updated in the config.js.

To run flashlight, cd into the directory and run "node app.js".  It will likely cause a re-index.
